# j2ee-app
This project is based on a course that lead me throughout the development of a Java application from the scratch. 
This project put together a lot technologies like coding a whole application, passing through the project creation, 
writing unit and integration tests, creating the database, configuring the application server, deploying the application and 
performing real tests.

This project covers a lot of Java technologies that were used in practice while creating and buidling this project; including:

    Java EE 7: JPA 2.1, Bean Validation 1.1, JMS 2.0, EJB 3.2, CDI 1.1, JAX-RS 2.0, security.
    Java 8: Lambda expressions, Date and Time API, streams and more.
    Libraries such as Gson, JUnit, Mockito and Hamcrest.
    Arquillian for integration tests.
    Wildfly 8 (former JBoss) as Application Server.
    PostgreSQL for production and HSQLDB/H2 for unit and integration tests.
    Maven.
    Eclipse IDE (this is a Maven project, so you can use other IDE).
